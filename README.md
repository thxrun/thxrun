Hi there, I’m Tharun 👋

Learning MLOps in Public | Aspiring MLOps / ML Engineer

I’m learning how to take machine learning models from experimentation to production.
My focus is on building reliable, automated, and scalable ML pipelines using real-world MLOps tools.

🚀 What I’m Working On Now

Building a Production-Ready MLOps Pipeline for Vehicle Insurance Prediction

Applying real-world practices for:

Automated data ingestion & validation

Model training, evaluation, and deployment

Containerized ML workflows

🧠 Featured Projects
🔹 Production-Ready MLOps Pipeline – Vehicle Insurance Prediction (In Progress)

   A real-world MLOps pipeline that automates the complete ML lifecycle—from data ingestion to deployment—designed to simulate industry-grade ML systems.

🔹 End-to-End MLOps Pipeline with DVC

   Built a full ML pipeline using DVC for data versioning and MLflow for experiment tracking, ensuring reproducible and traceable model training workflows.

🔧 Skills & Tools
